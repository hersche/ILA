This is the Apps folder. You can put almost everything in here that your system can execute,
including shortcuts, batchfiles, playlists, links, exec-files, jar-files, pictures, mp3s ...
ILA will automatically search this folder and all subfolders if you ask her to open/start/run
something.

note1: filenames are not automatically added to the sphinx grammar ... yet ... buuut
to the dynamic language model, so if you are using grammar free mode you can directly ask for
files in here!

note2: keep the names simple, chance is high that exotic words are not in the dictionary and
ILA will not understand them and please write numbers as words (2=two etc.) if you are not 
using the Google API. Of cause you can add words to the dictionary if you want :-)

!important!: Linux and Mac have some troubles with spaces, you might want to replace all of them
with _ or - and also avoid sub-folders with spaces in the name. I'm still trying to fix this.

For every file-extension you can set a default program to open. Please have a look at the:

	app.defaults.config

file. Setting programs there will also (most likely) give you the advantage of closing this
program with a voice command ("open my rock mix" - "close the last process". To be extended ^^)

note3: using Java to execute shortcuts (e.g.: .lnk files) will usually not give you the ability
to close these processes. Use "custom system command" or "custom App/File" to give you more
options.
