These are the JAVA wrapper files for Pocketsphinx created from the latest
Pocketsphinx and Sphinxbase (March 2015). If you have to build your own
libraries you can use them either by compiling them with gcc (pocketsphinx
has a makefile for that in /Swig/Java/) or including them in Visual Studio
20XY. See ILA homepage for more details.
